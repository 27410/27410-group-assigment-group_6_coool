    "### 1.1 Literature review of the compound (<500 words)\n",
    "Malaria is a parasitic, life-threatening disease which is both preventable and curable. In 2020, there were an estimated 241 million cases worldwide, causing approximately 627 thousand deaths according to the WHO. 95% of those malaria cases took place in Africa, often in poor, rural areas with limited access to proper medical attention (WHO, 2022). To combat malarial infections, high quantities of low-cost antimalarial drugs are crucial to making treatment accessible. Artemisin is a potent antimalarial drug which could possibly provide an answer to the large death toll of malaria alltogether. However, production of artemisin is currently too expensive to be widely accessible in rural africa, mostly due to low yields in the production methods. Artemisinin global market size was estimated at USD 61 Million as 2021 (360ResearchReports, 2022). The demand for the product has risen dramatically after the World Health Organization recognized it as a first-line treatment for malaria (WHO, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "Artemisin is currently being industrially produced through one of two methods. Firstly, through *Artemisia annua*, a plant which is natively able to synthesisze artimesin from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). However, production using *A. annua* is too slow and costly to meet market demands (Li et al. 2016). Therefore a second alternative was developed by Ro et al. (2006). They used *A. annua*'s artemisin pathway as a framework for engineering an artemisin-producing cell factory. However, the final step of the artemisin pathway, conversion of artemisinic acid to artemisin, is currently unknown. Therefore, they decided to engineer the production of artemisinic acid in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, and chemically synthesize the final step of the production, as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](documents\\Artemisin_synthesis.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure above is adapted from Li et al. (2016). The engineered biosynthetic pathway above starts at FPP, which is a precursor for steroids in both plants and fungi, and it stems from the mevalonate pathway. From there amorphadiene synthase (ADS) cleaves off the pryophoshpate group to close the ring structures in the molecule, resulting in 4,11-amorphadiene. Cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP71AV1) catalyzes the monooxidation of 4,11-amorphadiene into artemisinic alcohol, which is further oxidised artemisinic aldehyde and finally artemisinic acid via NAD-dependent artemisinic alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1) and artemisinic aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH1) respectively. The conversion from artemisinic acid into artemisinin is generally considered feasible because it's performed at a low cost, with high yields in industry already (Paniego and Guiletti, 1996). Thus, an efficient cell factory, generating high yields of artemisinic acid could be the answer to finding a low-cost antimalarial drug. "

    "\n",
    "Aspergillus niger is a filamentous fungus, which can be found in almost every habitat on earth, including soil, ocean water and arctic ice. After germination of a spore, the fungus grows as hyphae, branching filaments that form the mycelial network on solid substrate, or pellet-like mycelial aggregates in submerged liquid culture [5]. Its high growth rate, relatively short life cycle and ability to grow on a variety of substrates account for A. nigerâ€™s robustness and ubiquity in nature. [1][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Adapted to its lifestyle of a decomposer of organic matter, it has an enormous productivity and secretion capability of proteins, acids and small molecules. This has been exploited by industry to produce a vast number of organic acids, enzymes, biopharmaceuticals and secondary metabolites, making it an important workhorse in biotechnology. [3]\n",
    "In competition and symbiosis with other fungi and microorganisms, it evolved an extensive SM production machinery of, amongst others, sesquiterpenoids, to compete and communicate with surrounding organisms. Genome-mining revealed that 99 core SM synthase enzymes are present in A. niger, which highlights its potential as SM cell factory [4].\n",
    "\n",
    "Being extensively used in biotechnological manufacturing and research, A. niger is a well-studied production host with a variety of synthetic biology tools available for genetic engineering. Besides Crispr-Cas9 for genome editing [6] and RNAi systems for gene-knock down [7], multiple highly optimized inducible promoters have been developed for controlled gene expression [8]. Numerous scientific papers and several genome-scale models provide a solid data basis for in-silico cell-factory engineering [9][10].\n",
    "\n",
    "A disadvantage of A. niger is its natural phenotype of branching filaments, which poses challenges for the fermentation process, since the mycelial aggregates increase viscosity and limit oxygen transfer. Also, it is not as well understood and has a smaller molecular toolbox than S. cerevisiae [14].\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous potential alternative cell factories for the production of artemisinic acid. Prerequisite is the presence of a precursor in the metabolism. It can be farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) like in this report, but technically could also be upstream of FPP, when the enzymes for the production of FPP are included in the heterologous pathway. However, the host should be chosen to provide a precursor as close to the final product as possible, to make use of the natural synthesis capabilities of the wild-type metabolism. FPP is part of the mevalonate pathway, which is present in all eucaryotes and archaea, and in some bacteria [11]. It is used to produce sesquiterpenoids, an extremely diverse class of secondary metabolites, of which many have bioactive properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the majority of pharmaceutical sesquiterpenoids are extracted from plants, which highlights their superior production capabilities [12]. The largest share of artemisin production globally is contributed by its natural production host, the plant Artemisia annua. Alternatively, industrial production hosts like tobacco or algae could harness the sesquiterpenoid synthesis potential of plants [13]. However, since industrial-scale production of plants is challenging, the biosynthetic pathway for artemisinic acid was introduced into the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for fermentation-based manufacturing. S. cerevisiae is the best known eucaryotic production host and extensively used for biosynthetic pathway engineering, but its SM production machinery and secretion capability are inferior to A. niger [14].\n"

    "The Genome-scale metabolic models (GSM models) are premrily based on three commonly used strains: strain ATCC1015 represents a wild-type that naturally produces citric acid, and the strain CBS513 is an enzyme-producing strain in industrial use. Strain DS03043 is another useful mutant that has higher cell growth, glucose uptake, and glucoamylase production rates but lower oxalic acid and citric acid secretion rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the recent five years, four papers was published around the GSM models of A.niger based on above-mentioned strains. These models are named iDU1756, iJB1325, iHL1210 and eciJB1325, as shown below. The iJB1325 model has two variations based on ATCC1015 strain GSM and CBS513 strain GSM. \n",

    "Compare to earlier iHL1210 model, the fully upgraded iJB1325 model has included 556 more reactions, 115 more genes and more than 200 test cases, which makes it more accurate than previous GSM models. On the other hand, the model iDU1756 has many differences compare to iJB1325, but the model file has errors which cannot be validated by SBML file standard. The most recent published model eciJB1325 is an enzyme-constrained GSM model based on original iJB1325 model with kinetic parameters and abundance information of enzymes. Based on literature, the extra enzymetic information supposed to improve phenotypic prediction and enhances simulation reliability. Therefore, iHL1210 and iDU1756 are discarded in the MEMOTE model analysis, and two strain GSM variations based on ATCC1015 and CBS513 are included.

All three models have very similar scores, but ATCC1015 and CBS513 has a slightly higher score due to their fully annotated metabolites. On the other hand, eciJB1325 integrates 1255 enzymesâ€™ kinetics and abundance into the iJB1325 GSM model of A. niger, so the number of reactions, metabolites and reactions increased significantly. However, we have not found relevant enzymatic information for our pathway and this project will include an OptKnock analysis, thus it is important to use the original iJB1325 model without enzyme kinetics. Finally, the ATCC1015 is a well-documented strain with more experimental data, the ATCC1015 GSM model is more suitable in this project. \n",
