# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 6 - artemisinic acid production in Aspergillus niger

## Project summary (<300 words)
The goal of our project is to produce artemisinic acid in vitro using *A. niger* GSM models by engineering a biosynthetic pathway into it. In this project, we analyzed the potential use and market of artemisinin, and the natural biosynthetic pathway in *A. annua*. We thoroughly compared different *A. niger* GSM models, implemented the metabolites and reactions. We compared the theoretical yield of modified *A. niger* and *S. cervisiae*. We have found out the best medium for growth and its correlated theoretical yield. Furthermore, we made a gene regulation and knockout optimization through a few algorithms including FSEOF, OptGene and OptKnock. Finally, we tried manually knockout a few genes and pathways to get the highest yield.
